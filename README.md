# File-Encryption-Tool
The File Encryption Tool is a Python script that provides a simple and secure way to encrypt and decrypt sensitive files. It uses symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.


Features:

Symmetric Encryption: Uses the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode for symmetric encryption.
Asymmetric Encryption: Utilizes the Fernet encryption scheme for generating and managing cryptographic keys securely.
User-friendly Interface: Allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt files via a command-line interface, with clear prompts and instructions.
File Management: Provides functionality to save encrypted files and decrypt encrypted files, enhancing data security and accessibility.
Key Management: Automatically generates encryption keys and saves them securely, ensuring the confidentiality of encrypted data.
